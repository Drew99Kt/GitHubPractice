``` Github project

1. request collaborator access. (send your github name to me, or in this chat)
2. goto the link with the repo, click the code button and then click open in github desk top
3. clone the repo to your github, import to your eclipse
4. create a new feature branch, ex- F-AndrewsBranch
5. goto eclipse and import project if it isnt imported yet
6. make sure your working on your feature branch and not develop branch
7. add package inside of the src location with you name
8. add a class inside that package you made
9. go back to git hub desk top and commit your changes and push them to github
10. make a pull request and i will review it. ``` this is the second way to do this github project.  (its easier)  if you want to be a collaborator,  send your github name here and i will send the invite.
```any questions ask me in chat or send me a message```

 ```
NOTE: 
1.do not work any any one elses packages/branches 
2.all PR's to main will be rejected
3. do not work on the development branch (make a feature branch from development)```
